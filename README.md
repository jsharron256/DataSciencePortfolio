# DataSciencePortfolio
A collection of selected data science projects to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and personal interests.

## Contents

## In Progress
### 1. Basic Programming (Python/R)
- Develop a script to automate the process of collecting, cleaning, and storing data from financial APIs such as Alpha Vantage.
- Create a portfolio optimizer using the Modern Portfolio Theory.
- Design a risk management model to predict Value-at-Risk using Monte Carlo simulations.

### 2. Statistics and Probability
- Develop an A/B testing framework to measure the impact of different investment strategies.
- Create a probabilistic model for credit risk scoring.
- Analyze historical financial data and use inferential statistics to predict future trends.

### 3. Data Wrangling
- Clean and preprocess a large, messy financial dataset and create a detailed report about the process and the insights gained.
- Scrape unstructured financial data from the web and convert it into a structured format.
- Deal with missing data and outliers in a large financial dataset, providing justifications for your chosen methods.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Develop interactive dashboards to track key performance indicators (KPIs) for investment portfolios.
- Create a geographic visualization of market trends using data from multiple sources.
- Use heat maps to visualize the correlation between different stocks or assets.

### 5. Machine Learning
- Develop a prediction model for stock prices using regression techniques.
- Create a classification system to predict whether a loan would default.
- Use unsupervised learning to identify clusters of similar stocks or assets.

### 6. Big Data Processing (Spark/Hadoop)
- Implement a big data pipeline to process high-volume real-time trading data.
- Use Spark's MLlib to run machine learning algorithms on a large dataset of financial transactions.
- Process and analyze large datasets of stock prices using Hadoop MapReduce.

### 7. Recommender Systems
- Develop a recommendation system that suggests investment portfolios to users based on their past investments, risk profile, and market trends.
- Design a system that recommends stocks to investors based on their past investment history, similar investors' portfolios, and the investors' risk appetite.
- Implement a recommender system that suggests financial news articles or research papers based on the user's reading history, the user's investment portfolio, or trending topics in the user's interest area.

### 9. Advanced Machine Learning/Deep Learning
- Develop a neural network to predict stock prices using TensorFlow.
- Implement a deep learning model for sentiment analysis on financial news.
- Develop a reinforcement learning agent to perform algorithmic trading.

### 8. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Use NLP to analyze sentiment in financial news and correlate it with stock market performance.
- Implement a chatbot that can answer queries related to financial data.
- Extract key financial information from company annual reports using information retrieval techniques.

### 10. Image Recognition or Computer Vision
- Develop a computer vision system using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) that can read and digitize handwritten or printed numbers from bank checks or other financial documents.
- Implement a model that can identify anomalies or signs of tampering in financial documents such as receipts, invoices, or contracts.
- Use computer vision to identify common patterns (like "head and shoulders" or "double top") in trading charts, which are often used in technical analysis.

### 11. Data Ethics & Bias Analysis
- Using a dataset from a lending institution, analyze whether the lending decisions are biased based on attributes like race, gender, etc. Discuss how the bias could be mitigated.
- Analyze a recommender system for fairness. Ensure that the recommendations are not biased toward certain types of users.
- Implement a data analysis or machine learning project where privacy-preserving techniques (like differential privacy) are used. Discuss the trade-off between accuracy and privacy.

### 12. Time Series Analysis
- Use time series analysis to predict future stock prices.
- Create a model to predict economic indicators like GDP or unemployment rate.
- Implement a model to detect anomalies in time series trading data.

13. Deployment and Scaling (Cloud/AWS)
- Deploy a machine learning model on AWS and make it available as an API.
- Design a system on AWS to process and analyze streaming financial data.
- Create a scalable data storage solution on AWS for high-volume financial data.
